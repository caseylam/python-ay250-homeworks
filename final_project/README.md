This is a Flask webapp that allows the user to download model parameters and lightcurves from the
[MOA](http://www.massey.ac.nz/~iabond/moa/alerts/), 
[OGLE](https://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle4/ews/), and
[KMTNet](https://kmtnet.kasi.re.kr/~ulens/)
microlensing alert websites to a database.

It lets the user download stuff and then query the database.

It also allows the user to view MOA lightcurves in magnitude space (instead of flux difference space, which is not easily interpretable).
