    "Preliminary idea: an online data-base that lists good microlensing black hole candidates. Motivation: We want to choose photometric microlensing events from alert systems (i.e. MOA, KMTNet, hopefully OGLE soon) to follow up astrometrically. Currently, we look through alert pages and note anything interesting. But it's not ideal because 0) it is manual and very time consuming to click through all these webpages 1) we choose events based on reported parameters, which often get updated as time goes on-- so what looked good might not be so good two weeks later, or vice versa.  2) it's not very well organized. 3) I want to additionally process the data, so a batch way of downloading lightcurves and re-analyzing them myself would be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I propose to use flask to make an online webapp where you can choose requirements (say on tE, baseline magnitude, change in magnification) then will automatically return links to all those alerts across  several alert systems, as well as an option to re-analyze the data. Then you can re-run it to see if you get new updates. This will require knowledge of interacting with the web, databases, and maybe application building\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to think about how can persistently host the app and make sure that the DB in the backend is not destroyed when the (python) webserver goes down."
